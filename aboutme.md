My name is Andrea Christelle and these are my interests:

- data science, politics, ethics, philosophy
- insights & ideas

Studying philosophy taught me to ask hard questions. 

### my history

In my [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea6WD9ulxFw) I reflect on the importance of values and nature. Bonus: cool digeridoo intro.
